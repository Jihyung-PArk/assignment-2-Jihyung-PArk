# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Jihyung Park

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
I started to review Assignment 2 on 12/04/2022. It took three days to understand the Assignment 2 task. I tried to finish "place.py" and "test-place.py" until 13/04/2022. After that, I tried to complete "placecollection.py" and "test-placecollection.py" until 16/04/2022. Unfortunately, it took a few days more. So, It finished on 19/03/2022. Nextly, "main.py" took around one week. In short, Assignment 2 took 17days.

Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
...
I am most satisfied with the part where I set up the overall logic in advance before starting write code, and then made detailed coding intentionally. When writing short code, the overall logic may not be very important. However, the longer and more complex the code, the more important it is to create an overall framework. Therefore, before starting assignment2, I feel satisfied that I have made a sufficient plan in advance.
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...
I am not satisfied with the function that add_place in main.py. It was not clear where the widgets in the GUI had a value and how to use the value. I didn't know how to use that value, so I ended up using a bypass method to complicate the code. The code would have been simpler if we could know how to use the values that exist in the widget.
## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...
The planning partworked well. I made a plan before the start, and it went smoothly both in time and mentally. By creating several small goals, and I focused on achieving those goals. The small goals that were gathered were combined to complete assignment2.
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...
I will improve it to make the overall code simpler. Complex code makes it difficult to understand for both developers and anyone who reads the code. Therefore, from the next project onwards, I will try to make the code simpler and easier to understand.
## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...
I used the lecture note as a basis, and the parts I couldn't find in the lecture note I used the codes made in weekly practical. also, I used W3school and YouTube for addition resources. Through the mentioned methods, I tried to understand how the code I want to use is used, and wrote my own code using that study.
## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... 
The main problem I faced was connecting Kivy and Class. In order to connect Kivy and Class, it was necessary to understand each language, and it was difficult to connect because the knowledge of Kivy was less compared to Class. To connect the two languages, I studied and understood practical examples one by one. And through that study, I tried to connect class and Kivy.
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
I can easily manage overlapping data in other python files through the class. And there is no need to use repetitive functions when writing code. Through this, errors that may occur when writing the code can be reduced, and the time can be shortened.
